An OCaml client library for Discord

This is a very experimental (translation: weekend hack) client library for
[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) written in OCaml. The name is a Discordian
pun.

So far it can connect to Discord and spew buckets of JSON to the terminal it's
running in. Hopefully it'll do something more interesting soon.
